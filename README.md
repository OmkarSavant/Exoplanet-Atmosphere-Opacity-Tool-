# Exoplanet-Atmosphere-Opacity-Tool-
This is a web tool for astrophysicists to use to visualize predictions the opacities of exoplanet atmospheres. Traditionally, this is a tedious process that can only be done by hand by a few experts in the field because of the millions of data points to sift through. This tool accesses a repository of more than 93 million data points to interpolate and present data to scientists about the abundance of certain chemicals as well as their spectral signatures on planets given the expected pressures and temperatures. I wrote this with a partner, Adele Bloch, while interning at UC Santa Cruz under Caroline Morley.
