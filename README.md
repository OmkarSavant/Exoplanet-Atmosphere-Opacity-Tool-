# Exoplanet-Atmosphere-Opacity-Tool-
This is a web tool for astrophysicists to use to visualize predictions the opacities of exoplanet atmospheres. Traditionally, this is a tedious process that can only be done by hand by a few experts in the field because of the millions of data points to sift through. This tool accesses a repository of more than 93 million data points maintained by the University of California, uses bilinear interpolation to create a profile, and presents data to scientists about the abundance of certain chemicals as well as their spectral signatures on planets given the expected pressures and temperatures. I wrote this with a partner, Adele Bloch, while interning at UC Santa Cruz under Caroline Morley. I wrote the backend code, while Adele. This project was selected as a Siemen's competition semifinalist in 2015.
